# My First Independent Machine Learning Project
## Detecting Fraudulent Credit Card Transactions with Machine Learning Methods
### Background
This is my first independent attempt to apply machine learning methods to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Below is an outline of steps taken from beginning to end.
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to apply the regression modeling methods (e.g. ridge regression, model evalulation, cross-validation) from IBM's Data Analysis with Python course to generate the best-fit model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using the 'credit card fraud' dataset provided by the Machine Learnign Group - ULB on Kaggle.
### Set Up Authentication
If downloading the dataset through Kaggle's public API, you will need to first [create a new token]([url](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api#authentication)). https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api#authentication
### Data Source
We will download the creditcard.csv dataset from [Kaggle]([url](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/data)). https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/data
